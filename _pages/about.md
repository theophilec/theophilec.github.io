After my engineering degree at [Mines Paris - PSL](https://minesparis.psl.eu), I defended my PhD in machine learning in 2024, supervised by Alessandro Rudi, Carlo Ciliberto and Benjamin Guedj, on the topic of structure in ML methods. You can read my thesis [here](https://theses.fr/2024UPSLE004).

**Open to work**: I am actively looking for a Machine Learning Engineer or Full Stack Data Scientist position. Some things I value: a team to learn with, an impactful product to build and deploy, and the opportunity to have an impact. I am open to branching out from ML to signal processing, optimization, systems engineering,... please get in touch!

Right now, I am building tools in Python and Rust, around ML and the web. Trying to blog about it. Everything is on [Github](https://github.com/theophilec) and on my [blog](/blog).
