I am a PhD student in the SIERRA team at Inria Paris, working under the supervision of Alessandro Rudi and Benjamin Guedj.

My work leverages approximate kernel methods to develop and study maching learning algorithms. I've worked on invariances and time series.

This site is still (a bit) under construction.

**Open to work**: I am looking for a permanent position as a Machine Learning Scientist or Engineer in or around Paris from Septembre 2024. Get in touch !
