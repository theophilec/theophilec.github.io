I am a Machine learning engineer at [Pennylane](https://pennylane.com), a French accounting tech scale-up.

Before that, I studied engineering  at [Mines Paris - PSL](https://minesparis.psl.eu), machine learning at [Sorbonne Université](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/), and earned my PhD in machine learning from [École Normale Supérieure](https://ens.psl.eu) in the [SIERRA team](https://sierra-mlopt.github.io/) at [Inria Paris](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-paris), supervised by Alessandro Rudi, Carlo Ciliberto and Benjamin Guedj, on the topic of structure in ML methods. You can read my thesis [here](https://theses.fr/2024UPSLE004).
