My name is Théophile, I live in Paris, and I am interested in technology.

I am a machine learning PhD (Inria, École Normale Supérieure) and engineer (Mines Paris, Sorbonne Univerité).

**Open to work**: I am actively looking for a Machine Learning Engineer position. Some things I value: a team to continue to learn with, an impactful product to build, and the opportunity to have an impact. I am open to branching out from ML to signal processing, optimization, systems engineering,... please get in touch!

I obtained my PhD in 2024 after three years in the SIERRA team at Inria Paris, working under the supervision of Alessandro Rudi, Benjamin Guedj and Carlo Ciliberto. During my PhD I developed and studied new methods in ML and statistical inference, with a focus on leveraging problems' structure (such as invariances or constraints). I used a lot of (approximate) kernel methods and Pytorch and JAX on the implementation side. I worked on three types of data: images, time-series and filtering for dynamical systems.

I am passionate about building and running communities. I co-run the Mines Paris Alumni network with [Philippe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalousdian/) and the other volunteers. I also co-run the Mines Alumni Intelligence Artificielle group inside of MPA with [Sebastián](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sebastian-partarrieu/) and [Emma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emma-bou-hanna/).
