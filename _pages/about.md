I am a PhD student in the SIERRA team at Inria Paris, working under the supervision of Alessandro Rudi and Benjamin Guedj.

My work leverages approximate kernel methods to develop and study maching learning algorithms. I've worked on invariances and time series.

This site is still (a bit) under construction.

**Open to work**: I am actively looking for a Machine Learning Engineer or Software Engineering position in or around Paris. I will be available in October 2024, and am particularly interested in joining a highly-technical team building a powerful product or service. I am open to branching out from ML to signal processing, optimization... get in touch!
