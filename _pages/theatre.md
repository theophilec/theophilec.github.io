Plays I have seen recently:

- Saw _La Longue Route_ written and played by Thierry Labatréussit (Théâtre Le Funambule, Paris). Great!
- Saw _Le Funambule_ by Jean Genet and Philippe Torreton (Théâtre Friche La Belle de Mai, Marseille). Great!
- Saw _Pauvre Bitos - Le dîner de têtes_ by Jean Anouilh with Maxime d’Aboville as Bitos (Théâtre Herberot, Paris). Great!
